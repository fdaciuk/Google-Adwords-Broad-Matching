# Google Adwords Broad Matching

Add a '+' before each word.

## Installation

You need to have NodeJS installed. Download the [NodeJS here](http://nodejs.org/download/) and follow the instructions for installation.

After that, download the files in this repository.

## Running

Create a file called `keywords.txt` with the words you need to add the "+" in front.

Run the following command in your terminal:
```
node app.js
```

When you receive the message `"Done!"` Check the file keywords.txt. The words are already ready to paste in Google Adwords :)

> PS. If the answer of the above command is `"! File OK"`, your file was already formatted with the "+" character before each word.
